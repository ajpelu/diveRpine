\title{Distance to Natural forests}
\usage{
dist2nf(x, nf_value)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{raster} object}

\item{nf_value}{The value of "Natural Forests" landscape class within the
raster (default value = 2).}
}
\value{
A \code{raster} object with the minimum distance for each raster pixel
}
\description{
\code{dist2nf} computes the distance between the target pine plantation and
all surroundings natural forests patches.
}
