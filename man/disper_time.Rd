\description{
It computes the seeds input into focal pine plantation along the time.
}
\details{
Compute the propagule input from each natural forest patch to pine
plantation target using three types of disperser and different equations.
The seed input into focal pine plantation depends on landscape configuration:
distance to the seed source and quantity and typology of vegetation patches;
and on the composition of the dispersal community. Data about amount of seed
introduced into pine plantation in Sierra Nevada mountain (SE Spain) comes
from Zamora et al. (2010). See references.
