\description{
Compute the propagule input from each patch to target pine plantation using
three classes of disperses and different kernels equations.
}
\details{
It computes the propagule input from each patch to focal pine plantation
using three classes of disperses and different kernels.
\itemize{The quantity and quality of seed dispersion are influenced by:
\item Seed sources: seed diversity in seed source patch, and patch size
\item Disperses: percentage of each disperser type
\item Landscape configuration
}
\itemize{Three classes of disperses were considered by default for the study
area:
\item small birds, \emph{e.g.} European robin (\emph{Erithacus rubecula}),
Sardinian warbler (\emph{Sylvia melanocephala})
\item medium birds, \emph{e.g.} Eurasian jay (\emph{Garrulus glandarius})
\item mammals, \emph{e.g.} Red fox (\emph{Vulpes vulpes})
}

\itemize{For each type of disperser, different dispersion kernels have been
considered.
\item Small-sized birds rarely exceed 100 m in distance, and approximately
50\\% of the seeds are dispersed in the first 50 m.
\item Medium-sized birds disperse 50\\% of the seeds over a distance of more
than 100 m. The Eurasyan jay shows a dispersion range between 5 and
1000 m for Sierra Nevada mountains (SE Spain). The distance at which
the maximum dispersion occurs depends on the target patch, being
approximately 400 me when the target patch is a pine plantation.
\item Mammals disperse in a range from 0 to more than 1500 m, with
the dispersion peak at 650 - 700 m. More than 50\\% of the seeds
dispersed by mammals are deposited at distances greater than 495 m.
}

This functions also considers the adjacency between each of the
natural forest patches and the focal pine plantation. It is known that the
higher the adjacency between the natural forest and the pine plantation, the
lower the limitation of the propagule entry dispersed by birds (Zamora et
al.2010). Then for each natural forest patch, the adjacency to pine-plantation
is computed. For those patches with adjacency, the potential dispersion by
birds increases according a factor (see Zamora et al. 2010).
