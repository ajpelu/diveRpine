\arguments{
\item{r}{A \code{raster} object with the configured landscape}

\item{draster}{A \code{raster} object with values of the distance from the
target patch to natural forest patches.}

\item{r_range}{A \verb{data frame} with three columns: \code{value} of land use
(\code{integer}: 0 = "Other", 1 = "Pine plantation", 2 = "Natural Forests",
3 = "Crop"); \code{lowRich} and \code{upRich} (lower and upper value of the
range of Richness)\insertCite{@see @GomezAparicio2009}{diveRpine}.}

\item{treedensity}{density of the pine plantation (\code{integer})}

\item{pastUse}{the past land use of the pine plantation (\code{character}).
One of "Oak", "Shrubland", "Pasture" or "Crop".}

\item{ftreeden, fdist}{functions used to computed the effect of tree
density (\code{ftreeden}), and of the distance to natural forest (\code{fdist})
on richness values within pine plantation. See details.}

\item{w_dist, w_treeden, w_past}{weights applied to the functions that
correct the plant richness values according to the distance to seed source,
the tree density, and the past-land use of the pine plantation.}

\item{rescale}{If "TRUE" the results are rescaled (0 = min and 1 = max)}
}
\value{
A \code{raster} object with values of initial richness for each
pixel.

\description{
This function computes the initial values of richness values for each patch.
}
\details{
This function computes the initial plant richness for the land-use
categories (\emph{e.g.} target pine-plantation, surrounding natural
forests, shrubland and crops). For each land-use category, the richness value
of the pixels in each of the patches is randomly calculated from a range
of potential richness values specified by \code{r_range}.

The range of plant richness values is specified by
\code{r_range}. In the diveRpine app, those values are calculated considering
the range of possible values found on the study area. I

Richness value for each of the patch classes (\emph{i.e.} pine plantation,
natural forests, shrubland and crops) are calculated considering the range
of possible values found on the study area. In this case we use data from
Sierra Nevada (southern Spain)

The richness values of each pixel of the focal (target) pine
patch depends on:
\itemize{
\item Stand structure: tree density, patch size, past land-use
\item Distance to seed source (landscape configuration)
}

Richenss value for each of the patch classes (\emph{i.e.} pine plantation,
natural forests, shrubland and crops) are calculated considering the range
of possible values found on the study area. In this case we use data from
Sierra Nevada (southern Spain) See References.
